# SCU Calendar App
The calendar app helps students find events on campus and event organizers promote their events to students.  Because only students who sign up for mailing lists are notified about events organized by clubs, events on campus are decentralized.  Many students are not aware of upcoming events on campus, which causes low attendance at many events.  The calendar app helps students get involved on campus by helping students find events that they are interested in.  The calendar app also helps event organizers plan logistics of events by helping event organizers check registration, students find the details of the events, and students receive reminders about events.
